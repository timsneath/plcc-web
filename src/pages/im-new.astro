<BaseLayout title="I’m New | Pine Lake Covenant Church">
  <h1>I’m New</h1>

  <p>
    Visiting a new church can feel unfamiliar — especially if you haven’t been to church in a while, or aren’t quite
    sure what you’re looking for. Whether you’re just curious or thinking about visiting for the first time, we’re glad
    you’re here.
  </p>

  <h2>Start here</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Plan a Visit</strong><br />
      What Sundays are like, where to go, and what to expect when you arrive.<br />
      <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}plan-a-visit/`}>Learn more</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Families</strong><br />
      Community, support, and programs for parents, kids, and youth — on Sundays and beyond.<br />
      <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}families/`}>Learn more</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>About Pine Lake</strong><br />
      Our story, values, and the kind of church we’re trying to be.<br />
      <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}about/`}>Learn more</a>
    </li>

    <li>
      <strong>Messages</strong><br />
      Curious what teaching is like? Watch or listen to a recent message.<br />
      <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}messages/`}>Listen or watch</a>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>What to expect here</h2>

  <p>
    You won’t be asked to introduce yourself, explain what you believe, or commit to anything. Some people who come to
    Pine Lake have deep faith, others are exploring, returning after time away, or connected through family or
    community.
  </p>

  <p>You’re welcome to participate at whatever pace feels right to you.</p>

  <p>
    If you’re wondering where to begin, most people start with
    <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}plan-a-visit/`}>Plan a Visit</a>
    or <a href={`${import.meta.env.BASE_URL}families/`}>Families</a>. Both will give you a clearer sense of what life at
    Pine Lake looks like.
