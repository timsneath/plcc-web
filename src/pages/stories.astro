      <h1>Stories from Pine Lake</h1>

      <p class="page__lede measure">
        Pine Lake is a community of real people learning to follow Jesus together. Here are a few glimpses of what that
        looks like across different seasons of life.

            We came from a larger church and realized we were starting to feel anonymous. At Pine Lake, people noticed us
            — and not in a “salesy” way. Just genuinely.

            I’m a single mom, and showing up somewhere new can feel like a lot. Pine Lake has been a place where my
            daughter is known and I don’t feel like I have to have it all together.

            We moved into the area with small kids and didn’t know anyone. Pine Lake helped us find community faster
            than we expected — especially through the people we met on Sundays.

            Our kids are older now — one is an adult, one is in the late-teen years — and we were looking for a place to
            settle in for this season. Pine Lake has felt grounded and welcoming from the start.

            We’re an African family, and it mattered to us that we’d be welcomed and able to build real friendships.
            We’ve found people here who are kind, curious, and genuinely glad we’re part of the church.

            We’ve been at Pine Lake since the 1990s. What we love is that it still feels like a church where people care
            for each other — and where new people are truly welcomed in.
