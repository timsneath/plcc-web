        Family life is busy, beautiful, and sometimes exhausting. At Pine Lake, we want to be a place where families
        feel supported, welcomed, and free to take part at whatever pace makes sense for them.

      <h2>Families on Sunday mornings</h2>

      <p>
        On Sundays, we offer programming for children and youth of all ages, from babies through high school. Parents
        are always welcome to keep their children with them, or to use the programs that best fit their family.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Programs available for <strong>ages 0–18</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Quick check-in</strong> in the foyer</li>
        <li>Consistent, caring volunteers who love kids</li>
        <li>
          A comfortable space where parents can <strong>watch the service while caring for babies and toddlers</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>One Sunday each month, our elementary-aged kids stay in the service to worship alongside their families.</p>

      <p>
        We don’t see kids and youth as something separate happening down the hall. They’re an important part of the life
        of the church, and we love finding ways for families to worship and grow together.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Safety and care</h2>

      <p>We take the responsibility of caring for children seriously.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>All volunteers are <strong>background checked</strong></li>
        <li>A <strong>secure check-in and pickup system</strong> is used</li>
        <li>There are always <strong>at least two adults</strong> in each room</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Our goal is to create an environment where kids feel safe and known, and parents can relax and be present.</p>

      <h2>Beyond Sunday mornings</h2>
      <p>
        Sundays are just one part of family life at Pine Lake. Beyond weekly services, there are simple, low-pressure
        ways for families to connect, build friendships, and support one another through everyday life. Here are a few:
      </p>

      <h3>Community Playgroup</h3>
      <p>
        A relaxed weekday gathering for parents and young children — a simple place to meet other families, let little
        ones play, and enjoy conversation (and coffee).
      </p>

      <h3>MomCo</h3>
      <p>
        A community of moms supporting one another so no one has to do the journey of parenting alone. Practical
        encouragement, real friendships, and space to breathe.
      </p>

      <h3>Club 45</h3>
      <p>
        For 4th and 5th graders: a fun, welcoming gathering with games, friendships, and activities that help kids grow
        in confidence and faith.
      </p>

      <h3>Sports Camp</h3>
      <p>
        A summer highlight: a week of fun, movement, music, and age-appropriate Bible teaching — a great way for kids to
        build friendships and make memories.
      </p>

      <p>Want help finding the right fit for your family? You’re always welcome to reach out — no pressure.</p>

      <h2>Questions?</h2>

      <p>
        If you’d like to ask about kids, youth, or family life at Pine Lake, you’re always welcome to reach out — but
        there’s no pressure to do so.
