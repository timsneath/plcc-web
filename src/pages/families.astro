<BaseLayout title="Families | Pine Lake Covenant Church">
  <h1>Families</h1>

  <p>
    Family life is busy, beautiful, and sometimes exhausting. At Pine Lake, we want to be a place where families feel
    supported, welcomed, and free to take part at whatever pace makes sense for them.
  </p>

  <p>
    Whether you’re visiting for the first time, connected through a youth group, or looking for a church community to
    grow alongside your kids, you’re welcome here.
  </p>

  <h2>Families on Sunday mornings</h2>

  <p>
    On Sundays, we offer programming for children and youth of all ages, from babies through high school. Parents are
    always welcome to keep their children with them, or to use the programs that best fit their family.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>Programs available for <strong>ages 0–18</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Quick check-in</strong> in the foyer</li>
    <li>Consistent, caring volunteers who love kids</li>
    <li>
      A comfortable space where parents can <strong>watch the service while caring for babies and toddlers</strong>
    </li>
  </ul>

  <p>One Sunday each month, our elementary-aged kids stay in the service to worship alongside their families.</p>

  <h2>Safety and care</h2>

  <p>We take the responsibility of caring for children seriously.</p>

  <ul>
    <li>All volunteers are <strong>background checked</strong></li>
    <li>A <strong>secure check-in and pickup system</strong> is used</li>
    <li>There are always <strong>at least two adults</strong> in each room</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Our goal is to create an environment where kids feel safe and known, and parents can relax and be present.</p>

  <h2>More than childcare</h2>

  <p>
    We see children and youth as an important part of the church, not a separate experience happening down the hall.
  </p>

  <p>
    Our hope is that kids grow up knowing they are part of God’s story, supported by caring adults and a wider community
    that knows their names.
  </p>

  <h2>Support for parents</h2>

  <p>
    Parenting can be joyful and challenging — often at the same time. Pine Lake offers spaces for parents to connect,
    learn, and support one another as we navigate family life together.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you’d like to learn more about parent-focused gatherings or groups, we’d love to help you find a good next step.
  </p>

  <h2>Questions?</h2>

  <p>
    If you’d like to ask about kids, youth, or family life at Pine Lake, you’re always welcome to reach out — but
    there’s no pressure to do so.
