  <h1>Community</h1>

  <p>
    Pine Lake is more than a Sunday gathering. For those who call this church home, community is where faith is
    practiced through relationships, service, generosity, and shared life.
  </p>

  <h2>Life together</h2>

  <p>
    Community at Pine Lake takes many forms — gathering in smaller groups, serving alongside others, and supporting one
    another through different seasons of life.
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Life Groups</strong><br />
      Small groups that meet regularly to build relationships, study Scripture, and grow together.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Serve & Volunteer</strong><br />
      Opportunities to serve within the church and in the wider community.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Practicing generosity</h2>

  <p>
    Giving is one way we respond to God’s generosity toward us. It supports the mission and ministries of Pine Lake and
    helps us care for our community, both locally and globally.
