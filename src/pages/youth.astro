      <h2>What a Tuesday night feels like</h2>
      <p>
        We begin with dinner because it’s hard to build community on an empty stomach. From there, the night includes
        time to connect, worship that’s accessible, teaching that’s grounded and practical, and small groups where
        students can talk honestly and be known.

      <h2>Want to get connected?</h2>
      <p>
        If you’re new, you’re welcome. If you’ve never been to a youth group, you’ll be fine. If you’ve been around
        church a lot—or hardly at all—this can still be a great place to grow.

      <h2>Discipleship &amp; highlights through the year</h2>
      <p>
        In addition to our weekly rhythm, we plan retreats, service opportunities, and trips that help students grow in
        faith and friendship. Here are a few of the recurring highlights.
      </p>

      <h3>Confirmation</h3>
      <p>
        Confirmation is a 6-month discipleship experience for students 8th grade and up, taking a deep dive into
        Scripture. Students are paired with a mentor to explore questions of life and faith, with monthly gatherings for
        group teaching. The year is capped off with Confirmation Sunday in early June.
      </p>

      <h3>Campbell Farm</h3>
      <p>
        Campbell Farm is the middle school highlight of the summer: a three-day discipleship trip to the Yakama nation
        in partnership with The Campbell Farm, a community and retreat center in Wapato, WA. The trip includes immersive
        cross-cultural learning experiences—and plenty of summer fun.
      </p>

      <h3>Retreats</h3>
      <p>
        Each year we make space for weekends designed for fun, worship, teaching, and building friendships—some hosted
        alongside other churches in our conference, and some as Pine Lake Youth retreats.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="measure">
      <h2>Service &amp; missions</h2>
      <p>
        We want students to see faith as something that moves outward—serving with others, showing up locally, and
        learning how to love our neighbors in practical ways.
      </p>
