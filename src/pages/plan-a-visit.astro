        Visiting a church for the first time can feel awkward — especially if you haven’t been to one in a while (or
        ever). Our hope at Pine Lake is simple: that you’d feel comfortable, unpressured, and free to participate at
        whatever level feels right to you.
      </p>

      <p class="page__lede">Here’s what a typical Sunday looks like.</p>

      <h2>What happens on a Sunday morning</h2>

      <p>
        Our services last about <strong>75 minutes</strong> and include a mix of music, teaching, and time together.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Around <strong>20 minutes of contemporary worship music</strong>, led by a band
          <br />
          <em>(You’re welcome to join in — or just listen.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>A short kids’ moment and a few brief Bible readings</li>
        <li>
          A brief meet-and-greet moment to say hello to those around you
          <br />
          <em>(No pressure — many people simply smile and stay seated.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          A <strong>20–25 minute message</strong> that’s thoughtful, practical, and grounded in the Bible
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Once a month, we also share <strong>communion</strong> together. You’re always free to participate — or not — as
        you feel comfortable.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>What should I wear?</h2>

      <p>Whatever you’re comfortable in.</p>

      <p>
        On any given Sunday you’ll see everything from <strong>Seahawks jerseys and jeans</strong> to
        <strong>smart casual</strong>. There’s no dress code, and no expectations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Will I stand out or be put on the spot?</h2>

      <p>No.</p>

      <p>
        You won’t be asked to introduce yourself, stand up, or share anything publicly. You’re free to come, observe,
        participate as much or as little as you like, and head out when the service ends.
      </p>

      <p>Coffee is served, conversation is optional, and pressure is not part of the experience.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Bringing kids?</h2>

      <p>We love families, and we work hard to make Sundays smooth for parents.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          Programs for children and youth of all ages, from <strong>0–18</strong>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Quick check-in</strong> in the foyer</li>
        <li>All volunteers are <strong>background checked</strong></li>
        <li>A <strong>secure pickup system</strong> for children</li>
        <li>At least <strong>two adults</strong> in every room</li>
        <li>
          One Sunday a month, <strong>K–5 students stay in the service</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        For babies and toddlers, there’s also a comfortable space where you can
        <strong>watch the service while caring for your child</strong>.

    <section class="section">
      <h2>A place to belong — no test required</h2>

      <p>
        Identity matters to us, but you’ll never be asked what you believe or feel like you have to pass some kind of
        test to be welcome here.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some people who come to Pine Lake are deeply rooted in their faith. Others are exploring, returning after time
        away, or connected through family or community. All are welcome.
      </p>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>Ready to come? Or just curious?</h2>

      <p>Whether you’re planning to visit this Sunday or simply getting a feel for who we are, we’re glad you’re here.</p>

      <p>
        If you’d like to connect with someone ahead of time, you’re always welcome to — but there’s no expectation that
        you do.
