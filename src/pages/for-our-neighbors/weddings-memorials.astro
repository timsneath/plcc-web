        Our lives include seasons of great joy and great sorrow. In both, we need community — people to celebrate with
        us and people to mourn with us. Pine Lake offers support in coordinating weddings and memorial services.

      <h2>Memorials</h2>
      <p>
        When a loved one dies, there is a need to commemorate their life and memory — and to find hope and comfort in
        the midst of grief. Our Memorial Team provides support for memorial services held at Pine Lake.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our Memorial Coordinator can assist with coordinating the service, scheduling participants, and arranging an
        after-service reception when appropriate. The coordinator works closely with pastoral staff to offer support
        and direction in planning a funeral or memorial service.
      </p>

      <p>
        For memorial service inquiries, please call
