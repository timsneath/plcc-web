    <p style="color:#555; margin-top:.25rem;">One-to-one care during difficult seasons of life</p>

    <p style="margin-top: 1rem;">
      Sometimes what helps most is having someone who will listen, care, and walk alongside you — consistently and
      confidentially — during a challenging season. Stephen Ministry provides that kind of support.

    <h2>What is Stephen Ministry?</h2>

    <p>
      Stephen Ministry is a confidential, one-to-one care relationship. Trained volunteers (called Stephen Ministers)
      meet regularly with individuals who are going through a difficult time.
    </p>

    <p>
      This might include grief, illness, caregiving stress, divorce, job loss, or other life transitions. Stephen
      Ministers are not counselors or therapists — they are caring listeners who offer presence, encouragement, and
      support.
    </p>

    <h2>Who is this for?</h2>

    <p>
      Stephen Ministry is for anyone who would benefit from steady, personal support during a challenging season. You
      don’t need to be a member of Pine Lake, and there’s no expectation that you already have a church background.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Those experiencing grief or loss</li>
      <li>People facing illness or caregiving responsibilities</li>
      <li>Individuals navigating major life changes</li>
      <li>Anyone feeling overwhelmed or isolated</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What does care look like?</h2>

    <p>
      A Stephen Minister meets with one person at a time, usually on a weekly basis, for as long as support is needed.
      These conversations are confidential and focused on listening, encouragement, and practical care.
    </p>

    <p>
      Stephen Ministers receive extensive training and ongoing supervision to ensure care is thoughtful, respectful, and
      trustworthy.
