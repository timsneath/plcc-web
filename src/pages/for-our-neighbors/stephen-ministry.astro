        Sometimes what helps most is having someone who will listen, care, and walk alongside you — consistently and
        confidentially — during a challenging season. Stephen Ministry provides that kind of support.

      <h2>What is Stephen Ministry?</h2>

      <p>
        Stephen Ministry is a confidential, one-to-one care relationship. Trained volunteers (called Stephen Ministers)
        meet regularly with individuals who are going through a difficult time.
      </p>

      <p>
        This might include grief, illness, caregiving stress, divorce, job loss, or other life transitions. Stephen
        Ministers are not counselors or therapists — they are caring listeners who offer presence, encouragement, and
        support.
      </p>

      <h2>Who is this for?</h2>

      <p>
        Stephen Ministry is for anyone who would benefit from steady, personal support during a challenging season. You
        don’t need to be a member of Pine Lake, and there’s no expectation that you already have a church background.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>Those experiencing grief or loss</li>
        <li>People facing illness or caregiving responsibilities</li>
        <li>Individuals navigating major life changes</li>
        <li>Anyone feeling overwhelmed or isolated</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>What does care look like?</h2>

      <p>
        A Stephen Minister meets with one person at a time, usually on a weekly basis, for as long as support is needed.
        These conversations are confidential and focused on listening, encouragement, and practical care.
      </p>

      <p>
        Stephen Ministers receive extensive training and ongoing supervision to ensure care is thoughtful, respectful,
        and trustworthy.

      <h2>How to get connected</h2>

      <p>
        If you think Stephen Ministry might be helpful — for yourself or someone you care about — we invite you to reach
        out. A coordinator will follow up privately to listen and help determine whether this is a good fit.
