      <p class="page__lede">
        When life is overwhelming, even simple tasks can feel heavy. Meals of Care is a way to offer practical help —
        one less thing to think about — during times of illness, recovery, grief, or family transition.

      <h2>What is Meals of Care?</h2>

      <p>
        Meals of Care provides short-term meal support for individuals and families going through a challenging season.
        This might include a recent surgery, serious illness, the arrival of a new baby, or a time of grief or loss.
      </p>

      <p>
        Meals are prepared and delivered by members of the Pine Lake community as a simple expression of care and
        support.

        member of Pine Lake to receive care.

      <ul>
        <li>Individuals or families facing illness or recovery</li>
        <li>Those grieving the loss of a loved one</li>

      <h2>How it works</h2>

      <p>
        Meal support is typically offered for a limited period of time, based on availability and need. We do our best
        to be thoughtful and respectful of dietary needs and schedules.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you’re unsure whether Meals of Care is a good fit, you’re welcome to reach out and ask — we’re happy to talk
        it through.
