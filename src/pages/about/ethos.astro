        At Pine Lake, we try to keep things simple. Our life together as a church is shaped by three core ideas:

    <section class="section" aria-label="Core ideas">
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Be with Jesus</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Become like Jesus</strong></li>
        <li><strong>Do what Jesus did</strong></li>
      </ul>

      <p>These guide how we follow Jesus, how we grow together, and how we seek to love and serve our community.</p>

      <h2>What we believe</h2>

      <p>We believe the Bible is a trustworthy guide for understanding God and learning how to live.</p>

      <p>
        We believe following Jesus is more than adopting a set of ideas: it’s about a real change of heart and
        direction.
      </p>

      <p>We believe the Church exists not just for itself, but to love, serve, and share hope with the world.</p>

      <p>We believe faith is meant to be lived in community, where people support one another and grow together.</p>

      <p>We believe God is present and active today through the Holy Spirit, guiding, shaping, and empowering us.</p>

      <p>We believe the Good News of the Gospel brings freedom from shame and fear, and offers grace for our failings.</p>
