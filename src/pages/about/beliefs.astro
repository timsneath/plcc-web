  <h1>What We Believe</h1>

  <p>
    This page offers a bit more detail about the Christian beliefs that shape Pine Lake Covenant Church, and how those
    beliefs connect us to the wider Evangelical Covenant Church. Our aim is to be clear and thoughtful, while keeping
    the focus on what matters most.
  </p>

  <h2>Scripture</h2>
  <p>
    We look to the Bible as the primary guide for understanding who God is and how we are called to live. We trust
    Scripture to shape our faith, our life together as a church, and our mission in the world.
  </p>

  <h2>New life in Christ</h2>
  <p>
    We believe following Jesus involves real transformation — a new beginning marked by forgiveness, grace, and a
    growing life of love, joy, and peace. This new life is not a one-time event, but a lifelong journey of growth and
    formation.
  </p>

  <h2>The mission of the Church</h2>
  <p>
    We believe the Church exists not for itself, but to participate in God’s work of restoring the world. This includes
    sharing the good news of Jesus, forming disciples, and practicing compassion, mercy, and justice in our communities
    and beyond.
  </p>

  <h2>Life together</h2>
  <p>
    We believe faith is meant to be lived in community. The Church is not primarily a building or an institution, but a
    fellowship of believers learning to follow Jesus together. We believe all followers of Christ share in the life and
    ministry of the Church.
  </p>

  <h2>The Holy Spirit</h2>
  <p>
    We believe God is present and active today through the Holy Spirit. The Spirit draws people to Christ, shapes our
    lives, equips us with gifts, and empowers us to love, serve, and bear witness in the world.
  </p>

  <h2>Freedom in Christ</h2>
  <p>
    We believe the Good News of the Gospel brings freedom from shame and fear, and offers grace for our failings. United
    in Christ, we seek to focus on what unites us rather than what divides us, extending generosity and grace to one
    another where faithful Christians may differ.
