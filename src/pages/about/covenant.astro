      <h1>The Evangelical Covenant Church</h1>

      <p class="page__lede">
        Pine Lake is part of the Evangelical Covenant Church (often shortened to “the Covenant”). That means we’re
        connected to a wider family of churches who share a historic Christian faith, a commitment to the Bible, and a
        practical focus on following Jesus in everyday life.

      <h2>Why a denomination?</h2>

      <p>
        For us, being part of a denomination isn’t about being institutional — it’s about being accountable, supported,
        and connected. The Covenant provides shared theology, pastoral care and training, and partnership in mission,
        both locally and globally.

      <h2>What the Covenant emphasizes</h2>

      <p>
        The Covenant is shaped by a few long-standing convictions — a combination of historic Christian orthodoxy and a
        warm, lived faith:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Scripture</strong> — We look to the Bible as our primary guide for faith and life.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>New life in Christ</strong> — Following Jesus is not just an idea; it’s transformation and renewal.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Mission</strong> — The Church exists to share the good news of Jesus and to love and serve the world
          with compassion and justice.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Community</strong> — Faith grows best in fellowship, not isolation.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>The Holy Spirit</strong> — We depend on the Spirit’s presence and power to guide and equip us.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Freedom in Christ</strong> — We seek unity in essentials, grace in differences, and humility in how we
          hold our convictions.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="section">
      <h2>A posture of unity and grace</h2>

      <p>
        One distinctive of the Covenant is our desire to focus on what unites followers of Jesus rather than what
        divides us. Where faithful Christians may differ on secondary issues, we aim to be thoughtful, generous, and
        grounded — keeping Jesus at the center.
      </p>

      <h2>Connected beyond Pine Lake</h2>

      <p>
        Being Covenant connects Pine Lake to churches across the U.S. and around the world, as well as missionaries and
        partner organizations. It also provides oversight and support for our pastors and leaders.
