# Pine Lake Covenant Church – Website Prototype

This repository is a fast-iteration prototype for the Pine Lake Covenant Church website.

Goals:

- Experiment with information architecture for new visitors
- Explore a photo-rich, editorial visual style
- Optimize for young families and first-time guests
- Stay static, fast, and GitHub Pages–friendly

Non-goals (for now):

- CMS integration
- Full Church Center API integration
- Long-term hosting decisions

This site is built with Astro and deployed via GitHub Pages.
